Compile the code and run it, Defender will snipe it off the disk as soon as it leaves gcc's warm embrace.

I couldnt even get this code to run with a nop sled as the shellcode, lucky our ablation study executes
this as shellcode in memory!

Windows Defender cant get its grubby little hands on the shellcode when its being downloaded from the 
internet and run in memory.

Fileless malware baby!
