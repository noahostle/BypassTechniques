as soon as main.exe reaches disk, Windows Defender picks it up and quarantines it
however since emptyshellcode.exe does not contain any shellcode, it can run without
defender interference, therefore, it is the shellcode that is being detected, not the
code for the stager itself.

Obfuscating out the shellcode may lead to better results...
